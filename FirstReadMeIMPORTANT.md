## A simple chat application

Imp: In this repository I have not added any of the node modules folder.....once you will run the command<br>
`npx create-react-app project-name` automatically node modules will be added to the app.


### Usage of the application
If you have the npm installed on your machine then just create a 'React App' using the command:
`npx create-react-app project-name`

###Addtional Items:
in the applicaton I have installed some other npm packeges like Firebase, material Ui
So the list of the commands are

`cd project-name`

`npm install -g firebase-tools`

`npm install @material-ui/core`

`npm install firebase`

`npm install react-flip-move`

`npm install @material-icons`



### FInal thing to do
Now once you installed all the required package then you can delete all the files from the `src` directory 
and copy files from `src` from my repository.
Then paste the file into the `src` directory

now run the command 
`npm start`
